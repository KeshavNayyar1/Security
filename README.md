This PowerShell project simulates fundamental network and security management concepts, including the OSI Model, the CIA Triad, security tools, and Identity and Access Management (IAM). The script demonstrates key functionalities such as encrypting and decrypting files, monitoring network availability, scanning for open ports, and simulating vulnerability checks. Additionally, it showcases an IAM system with role-based access control (RBAC), enforcing permissions based on user roles like Admin, User, and Guest. Password policy enforcement and user login with activity logging are also included, simulating real-world security best practices. This project provides a comprehensive overview of secure network management and access control using PowerShell scripting.
